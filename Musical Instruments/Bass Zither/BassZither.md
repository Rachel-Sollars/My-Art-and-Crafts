# Bass Zither #

I invented and fabricated this bass zither type instrument. There are two bass strings (literally bass guitar strings) that act as a drone note. I like to tune these to either the 1 and 5 of the scale I'm playing or its root and relative minor. There is also a guitar string that is played. This string is kind of just floating there, so the instrument needs to be played with a glass slide. Because of this vibrato can be achieved with both varied position and pressure. The thin plywood on the top of the instrument vibrates, and the air pocket between it and the ground act as a resonating chamber, so the instrument is shockingly loud.

It is unbelievably hard to play this instrument both because it is fretless, and because if you vary pressure, the same position on the string will give different notes. Because of this I decided to go for a sticker bomb aethetic, so that I would have more details on the body to use to orient myself.
