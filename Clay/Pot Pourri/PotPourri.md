# Pot Pourri #

I had been wanting to get a Pot Pourri bowl for a while, and eventually decided to make my own so that I could get exactly what I wanted. This was my first time working with clay since I was a child, but I found it to be pretty straitforward. I used a rolling pin to get the impression of ivy leafs from our garden, then when painting I rubbed metalic gold paint into the cracks with my finger. I painted over the excess to keep clean lines. The whole bowl is coated with UV-resin which, as it was my first time using the stuff, was a nightmare.
