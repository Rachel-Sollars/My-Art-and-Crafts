# Nisse #
This was my first attempt at carving. I used a only craft knife. The wood is from a buddleia that was growing too large in the front garden, and the finish is Boiled linseed oil.

The figure is of a Nisse, however I wasn't aware of this when I was carving it, as I was basing it loosely off of images online.
