# Jewlery Holder #

I wanted to improve upon my old earring holder. So I decided to try and design something that was both sleek and functional. I am really happy with how it turned out, and I love how well it displays my jewlery.

The overfilled glue around some of the pegs is from having to re-glue pegs that have been knocked off in transit.
